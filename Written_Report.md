# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wanted to use the available data from different Kickstarter-led campaigns to guide her in her own fundraising campagn for her play, *Fever*. 

Having come close to her goal of $10,000 in a short amount of time, she would like to see the success rates of campaigns based on their _launch dates_ and what their _funding goals_ are. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to search for patterns in campaign kickstart dates and goals and how they affected the status of the campaign. With this wealth of information, Louise can get a better understanding of the factors that affect future projects and what she can do to on her part to allow for a successful campaign and play.

## Analysis and Challenges
With detailed information on over 4100 Kickstarter led campaigns, there are several routes we can go with analyzing the data. 
Whether it be focusing on [USA](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Graphs%20and%20Charts/Parent%20Category%20Outcomes_USA.png) by [category of product/service](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Graphs%20and%20Charts/Parent%20Category%20Outcomes.png) or what time of the [year](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Graphs%20and%20Charts/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png) was most receptive, we can make some educated inferences on how Louise's future campaigns may go, what can be improved and what works in her favor.
 
With a myriad of information, it can be *challenging* to pinpoint what to stick to and what to avoid. 

In this case, focusing on other plays around the world, and then moving closer to home, gave a better idea of how similar plays faired in the past.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater Outcomes vs Launch Date](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_%20Launch.png)

As per our deductions, _May_ looks like the most promising month to start a campaign, with over a 100 successes that month! 

While there is a slow but steady decrease in success rates as we go to August, we can see a slight increase in October, before reaching an annual low during the winter holidays. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes vs Goal](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goal.png)

Based on our analysis and the Line gragh above, we can infer that campaigns with goals _less than $5000_ have a higher chance of having a successful campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While we are able to make some helpful deductions based on patterns in _Theater_ fundraising campaigns, if we were to take a closer look, you will see that there is no data later than 2017.

This could pose a problem espeically in the wake of the Covid pandemic, since it is likely that trends will have changed in the last 5 years. 
Without access to this data, it is important to keep in mind an extent of uncertainty. 



## Results
---
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. Prime time to launch the campaign for a play would be May. 
2. It is best to avoid any campaigns during the holidays, since they do not do good at all. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As per our findings, a goal within $5000 has a higher chance of succeeding than a campaign with a goal of $45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Certain categories lack useful data. While Louise's areas of interest, Plays has enough information to help make sound conclusions, clients interested in categories like journalism will not find this dataset useful. 

!Data available by Category](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Graphs%20and%20Charts/Data%20Available%20by%20Category.png)

This is where graphs portraying categories and subcategories can come in handy in making sure the dataset contains what the client is after. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Since Staff Pick is an objective field, we could see how reliable it really is based on Staff Picks being true Vs how successful the campaign was.

2. By focusing on Status of the campaigns and each individual category, we could single out categories that consistently do poorly and dig deeper to see what may be causing this failure. This can be useful in stratagizing for a successful campaign in that category.
