Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

This is a look at the overall Categories!

Now if we were to filter out just the US, 

![Parent Category Outcomes_US_Theater](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Parent%20Category%20Outcomes_Theater.png)

As you can see, we now notice a very *high* success rate in the Theater field.

When we look into the outcomes based on the Fundraising Launch dates, we notice that the launch is most successful in _May_.

We can also see that when looking strictly at the theater sub-category, _May_ still remains the most successful launch month.

We have also included the *Edinburgh Research* tab, where blurbs and other fundraiser related data is visible for the following:
1. Be Prepared
2. Checkpoint 22
3. Cutting off Kate Bush
4. Jestia and Raedon
5. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family
