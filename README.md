As you can see, when we filter out US outcome, we notice a very *high* success rate in the Theater field.

When we look into the outcomes based on the Fundraising Launch dates, we notice that the launch is most successful in _May_.

We can also see that when looking strictly at the theater sub-category, _May_ still remains the most successful launch month.

1. Be Prepared
2. Checkpoint 22
3. Cutting off Kate Bush
